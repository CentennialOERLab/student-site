Getting started with Pressbooks is easier than you think! Whether you're creating an open educational resource or publishing a digital book, Pressbooks offers a powerful, user-friendly platform designed for educators and authors alike. This blog post is especially geared toward students working in OER labs, guiding you step by step through setting up your account, navigating the dashboard, and building your book with confidence and ease.

1. Google Pressbooks and go to the [eCampusOntario](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/) Pressbooks
2. Click 'Sign In' on the right corner

## Book Structure in Pressbooks: Parts and Chapters

A book written in Pressbooks is made up of chapters which are grouped and ordered into parts. chapters are web pages or building blocks within which content is added. Parts are overarching sections that hold chapters (Pressbooks Guide). Please don't create all the chapters under the Main Body. Instead, create a separate part and then click the "Add Chapter" button next to it to organize your content properly.

![Chapters placed directly under the Main Body should be avoided and marked with a red cross to indicate incorrect structure.](/images/create_chapter_not_recommended.png)

The overall structure of the book should follow this format:

- Part 1
  - Chapter 1.1
  - Chapter 1.2
  - Chapter 1.3
- Part 2
  - Chapter 2.1
  - Chapter 2.2
  - Chapter 2.3

## Add Users to Your Book

Only Administrators of a book can add users to that book in Pressbooks. Here is how it’s done:

1. Click 'Users' tab on the left menu
   ![Users link and Add Exising User button are highlighted](/images/add_user_2.png)

3. Enter the email address and select role (Administrator can view and make changes on your book)
4. Click 'Add Existing User' button!

## CSS Styles

When customizing your Pressbooks project, applying custom CSS styles lets you tailor the look and feel of your content for both web and PDF formats—separately. Pressbooks allows you to add your own CSS through the “Appearance” > “Custom Styles” section, where you can target styles specifically for the webbook and for PDF (print and digital print) formats individually. This flexibility means you can create a visually engaging online version while keeping the print/PDF version clean and professional. Whether you're adjusting fonts, spacing, or layout elements, custom CSS gives you full control over your book’s presentation across different formats. The following steps explains in detail how to apply custom styles separately for both the web and PDF formats.

### Apply custom-css styles for Web

1. Hover your mouse to the 'Apperance' button on left side
2. Click 'custom styles'
   ![custom styles link is highlighted](/images/custom_css_1.png)

## Set Up and Enable H5P Content

H5P content brings interactive, engaging elements to your Pressbooks projects, transforming static text into dynamic learning experiences. With H5P, you can embed quizzes, interactive videos, drag-and-drop activities, flashcards, and more—right within your chapters. What makes H5P unique in Pressbooks is its seamless integration: content can be added directly into the body of your book, making it ideal for open educational resources (OER) and digital textbooks. By including H5P, you not only enhance student engagement but also support active learning across different formats and devices. The following steps explains how to create, enable, and insert H5P contents in the PressBooks.
